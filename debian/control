Description: Perl module for dumping Perl objects from/to XML
 XML::Dumper dumps Perl data to a structured XML format.
 .
 XML::Dumper can also read XML data that was previously dumped
 by the module and convert it back to Perl.
 .
 .
 This might be useful for dumping Perl objects to files
 using an XML format that can be reloaded or accessed by
 other programs. Maybe even other languages.
